# Effect-TS plugin for Pi

[Effect](https://effect.website) v4 skills and context injection for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Detects Effect projects, injects relevant patterns when you're reading Effect code, and provides scaffold tools and slash commands.

Supported release: **Effect 4.0.0-rc.112**. See [version compatibility and official sources](skills/effect-ts/references/version-compatibility.md) and [validation](validation/README.md). Other releases require matching documentation and API checks before using these patterns.

## Install

```bash
# Pi (extension + skills)
pi install https://github.com/joelhooks/effectts-skills

# Claude Code (plugin + skills)
npx plugins add joelhooks/effectts-skills

# Just the skills (any agent)
npx skills add joelhooks/effectts-skills
```

## What It Does

### Smart Context Injection

The extension resolves the consuming package's installed Effect version and:

- Shows the resolved installed Effect version in the status bar
- Detects Effect patterns in files you read (services, schemas, errors, testing, HTTP, CLI, etc.)
- Appends reference hints for the supported release
- Routes v3, unsupported releases, and unresolved installations to version guidance
- Generates scaffolds only when the installed Effect version matches the supported release

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/effect:docs <topic>` | Load a specific reference doc into context |
| `/effect:service <Name>` | Generate a service scaffold with layer and test layer |
| `/effect:test <Name>` | Generate a test scaffold with @effect/vitest |

**Available topics:** services, layers, data-modeling, schema, errors, testing, http, cli, config, processes, setup, version

### Tools (LLM-callable)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `effect_scaffold` | Generate Effect v4 boilerplate (service, schema, error, test) |
| `effect_docs` | Load Effect reference docs on a specific topic |
